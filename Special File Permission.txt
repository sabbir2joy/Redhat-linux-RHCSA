Special File Permission

There are 3 special permission that are available for executable files and directories. These are :

1. SUID permission
2. SGID permission
3. Sticky bit

SUID Bit: A file with SUID always executes as the user who owns the file, regardless of the user passing the command.
If the file owner doesn't have execute permissions, then use an uppercase S here.
Setting SUID bit
# chmod 4555 [path_to_file]

# ls -lrt /usr/bin/passwd
-r-sr-sr-x   1 root     sys        31396 Jan 20  2014 /usr/bin/passwd

SGID Bit
*If set on a file, it allows the file to be executed as the group that owns the file (similar to SUID)
*If set on a directory, any files created in the directory will have their group ownership set to that
 of the directory owner
# chmod 2555 [path_to_file]

Sticky Bit
At the directory level, it restricts file deletion. Only the owner (and root) of a file can remove
 the file within that directory. A common example of this is the /tmp directory:

# ls -ld /var/tmp
drwxrwxrwt  2   sys   sys   512   Jan 26 11:02  /var/tmp

- T refers to when the execute permissions are off.
- t refers to when the execute permissions are on.

Set sticky bit
# chmod +t [path_to_directory]
or 
# chmod 1777 [path_to_directory]
